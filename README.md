# Accident-data-analysis
This MS Excel dashboard visualizes UK road accident data to uncover critical insights into accident severity, location hotspots, timing trends, and environmental impacts. Designed to support decision-making for road safety initiatives, it integrates rich visual elements and interactivity to drive actionable conclusions from complex datasets.

CoreTech Lab needed an effective way to analyze and communicate trends in road accidents across the UK. They were grappling with fragmented data and lacked a centralized visual platform for decision-makers to understand key accident causes, timing, and severity breakdowns.

I was tasked with transforming raw accident data into an insightful and interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal was to create a comprehensive analysis tool that could:

Highlight top accident hotspots.

Show correlations between weather, speed, and accident severity.

Provide comparative breakdowns (e.g., urban vs. rural, day of week, vehicle type).

Be easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Cleaned and modeled the dataset in Power BI to ensure accuracy and relational integrity.

Developed visuals such as maps, bar/column charts, donut charts, and time-based graphs.

Applied filters for year, month, and severity to allow dynamic exploration.

Designed a sleek, user-friendly layout with consistent color schemes, icons, and typography.

Added key KPIs (e.g., total accidents, casualties, top risk speed) to guide user focus.

The dashboard empowered CoreTech Lab with a centralized analytics tool that improved clarity in road safety patterns and supported better policy development. It received strong positive feedback for its aesthetic quality and ease of use. Moreover, it helped identify:

High-risk zones and time periods.

The significant impact of weather conditions.

Disproportionate accident rates in urban areas.
