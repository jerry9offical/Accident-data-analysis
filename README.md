## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the MS Excel files and resources used to create a dynamic accident analysis dashboard for **CoreTech Lab**. The tool provides a centralized and visual means to:
- Analyze accident severity across different zones.
- Identify time and location hotspots.
- Examine the influence of environmental factors like weather and speed.
- Drive policy decisions and awareness campaigns.

## 🧠 Project Approach – STAR Methodology

### **S – Situation**
CoreTech Lab lacked a centralized system to visually analyze national accident data. With an increasing need to support road safety initiatives, there was a demand for a tool that could simplify accident trends and inform strategic decisions.

### **T – Task**
My task was to clean, model, and visualize the UK accident dataset in a way that:
- Uncovered meaningful patterns.
- Offered interactivity and deep-dive capability.
- Provided intuitive summaries for both technical and non-technical users.

### **A – Action**
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset in Power BI using Power Query and DAX.
- Developed KPI indicators for total accidents, casualties, top-risk speed, and others.
- Integrated filters for **year**, **month**, **severity**, and **urban/rural** context.
- Visualized accident hotspots using **heatmaps** and **interactive charts**.
- Structured the report into intuitive segments: Overview, Trends, Geography, and Conditions.

### **R – Result**
The final dashboard:
- Helped CoreTech Lab identify accident patterns and high-risk areas.
- Was praised for its clarity, interactivity, and clean design.
- Informed the team’s outreach and policy discussions around road safety.
- Showcased the power of visual storytelling using real-world data.

## 📊 Key Features
- Interactive slicers for custom filtering
- Clean KPI section (total accidents, casualties, peak hours)
- Geographic breakdown using maps
- Visual comparison of accident severity by environment
- Charts showing monthly, daily, and hourly distribution
- Vehicle type involvement and top speed correlation
