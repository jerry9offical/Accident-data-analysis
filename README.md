#  UK Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to explore and visualize UK road accident data. This project transforms complex datasets into meaningful insights to support road safety decisions and policy formulation.

## Overview

This repository contains the MS Excel files and resources used to create a dynamic accident analysis dashboard for **CoreTech Lab**. The tool provides a centralized and visual means to:
- Analyze accident severity across different zones.
- Identify time and location hotspots.
- Examine the influence of environmental factors like weather and speed.
- Drive policy decisions and awareness campaigns.

##  Project Approach 

### **S – Situation**
CoreTech Lab lacked a centralized system to visually analyze national accident data. With an increasing need to support road safety initiatives, there was a demand for a tool that could simplify accident trends and inform strategic decisions.

### **T – Task**
My task was to clean, model, and visualize the UK accident dataset in a way that:
- Uncovered meaningful patterns.
- Offered interactivity and deep-dive capability.
- Provided intuitive summaries for both technical and non-technical users.

### **A – Action**
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset in Power BI using Power Query and DAX.
- Developed KPI indicators for total accidents, casualties, top-risk speed, and others.
- Integrated filters for **year**, **month**, **severity**, and **urban/rural** context.
- Visualized accident hotspots using **heatmaps** and **interactive charts**.
- Structured the report into intuitive segments: Overview, Trends, Geography, and Conditions.

### **R – Result**
The final dashboard:
- Helped CoreTech Lab identify accident patterns and high-risk areas.
- Was praised for its clarity, interactivity, and clean design.
- Informed the team’s outreach and policy discussions around road safety.
- Showcased the power of visual storytelling using real-world data.

##  Key Features
- Interactive slicers for custom filtering
- Clean KPI section (total accidents, casualties, peak hours)
- Geographic breakdown using maps
- Visual comparison of accident severity by environment
- Charts showing monthly, daily, and hourly distribution
- Vehicle type involvement and top speed correlation
